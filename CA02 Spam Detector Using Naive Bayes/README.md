# CA-02
In this exercise we shall train the model with set of emails labelled as either from Spam or Not Spam. There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam category. Next, we shall test the model on 260 emails. We shall ask model to predict the category of this emails and compare the accuracy with correct classification that we already know.


Libraries used in the environment to be able to run the code include:

numpy 1.24.3
sklearn 1.3.0

Python Standard Library
os module
collections module

For this project, I am using two datasets. One for Training and the other for testing. They can be found here:
